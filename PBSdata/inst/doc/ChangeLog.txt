------------------------------

1.27.8 (2025-04-28)  [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Data
    + Added data objects `pdo' and `npgo' from package `pacea' (RH 250416)
    + Added data object `mei' from package `pacea' (RH 250428)
    + Added new list object called `gfm.codes' for codes generated by query `fos_mcatORF.sql' on table GFFOS.GF_MERGED_CATCH (RH 250428)
  * Documentation
    + Updated `dbcode.Rd' to briefly outline codes in list object `gfm.codes' (RH 250428)

1.27.7 (2025-03-05)  [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Data
    + Added historical Silvergray (SGR, 405) trawl catch from Ketchen (1980_gf) to data object `rrfhistory' (RH 250304)
  * BAT code
    + Changed copy program from `xxcopy.exe' to `robocopy.exe' in `Rcopy.bat' (RH 250305)

1.27.6 (2024-12-13)  [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Added new functions `capFun' and `make.loc.pjs' in new module `A01_Utility.r' (RH 241213)
  * Documentation
    + Moved `Links.html' back to `inst/doc' and put `background.jpg' into 'inst/fisg'  (RH 241115)
      - moving `Links.html' and `background.jpg' to `vignettes' rendered them invisible (not installed, stoopid R)
    + Added Rd files for functions `capFun' and `make.loc.pjs' (RH 241213)

1.27.5 (2024-11-15)  [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Added a new list object called `fos.codes' for code tables in GFFOS (241115)
  * Documentation
    + Moved `Links.html' and `background.jpg' from `inst/doc' to `vignettes' (RH 241115)

1.27.4 (2024-11-14)  [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Changed list object `dbcodes' to `gfb.codes', removing the first level (DB) in the list (RH 241113)
      - it's far easier for a user to access a data object for each database rather than have all DB's in one list
    + Added a new list object called `gfc.codes' for code tables in GFCatch (241114)
  * Documentation
    + Updated `Links.html' and added a background to the webpage (RH 241114)
      - R check doesn't like the use of a background file in `inst/doc':
      - The following files should probably not be installed: 'background.jpg'
      - Consider the use of a .Rinstignore file: see 'Writing R Extensions',
      - or move the vignette sources from 'inst/doc' to 'vignettes'.

1.27.3 (2024-11-13)  [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Added `dbcodes.r' in new module `C01_codes' (RH 241113)
      - perhaps smaller data objects can be stored as ASCII for portability
  * Data
    + Updated catch data object `orfhistory' (RH 240313)
    + Updated `Historical_Catch.mdb' and `Catch_Historical.xls' (RH 240313)

    + Updated data object `gear'. (RH 230313)
    + Updated data objects `orfhistory' and `rrfhistory' for catch reconstructions (includes minor PMFC areas and locality codes). (RH 230510)
    + Added new PolySet `major.pop' that shows PMFC areas for Pacific Ocean Perch and Yellowmouth Rockfish. (RH 230516)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the User's Guide (RH 230307)
    + Updated Rd files

1.27.1 (2020-07-14)
  * Code
    + PBStools needs a rebuilt PBSdata when using `R Under development (unstable) (2020-07-13 r78838)'.

1.27.0 (2019-08-23)
  * Data
    + Added AME's IPHC historical datasets from the package `gfiphc'. (RH 190823)

      - iphc.countData2013.rda
      - iphc.data1996to2002.rda
      - iphc.setData1995.rda
      - iphc.setData1995rs.rda

1.26.1 (2019-01-21)
  * Topo
    + Fixed incorrect SIDs for PID 238 (changed 2 to 1) and PID 239 (changed 3 to 1) in `locality.plus'. (RH 190121)
    + Removed small holes (<=3 vertices) from and fixed 2 badholes in `rca'. (RH 180827)
  * Documentation
    + Modified the Rd example for `locality'. (RH 180104)
      - Note: PBSmapping function `addLabels' does not seem to work as it did previously.

1.26.0 (2017-12-21)
  * Topo
    + Added new data object `locality.plus' that covers the entire BC coast (RH 171221)
      - The original object `locality' describes BC fishing grounds and features large gaps.

## PBSfishery History
## ==================

    + Removed data objects as they now reside in a separate package called 'PBSdata'. (RH 120417)

1.20  2012-02-27  Authors
  * PBSmapx
    + Added new argument `leg.font' to `par.map' to allow user to change the font parameter of the legend (still uses `mono' family). (RH 120227)
    + Wrapped the events information in the legend if minimum vessels/cell > 1. (RH 120227)
  * PBStools
    + Revised `requestAges' to allow argument `nfree' to select otoliths from samples with minimum number of otoliths. (RH 120227)
  * PBSmapx
    + Removed `GLOP' button from map GUI and added `GOP' (grid over plot) and `LOP' (land over plot) buttons. (RH 120223)

    + Used `packageStartupMessage' rather than `cat' in `.onLoad' in `zzz.r'. (RH 111114)
    + Resaved the `.rda' data files using compress = "bzip2". (RH 111114)
    + Building PDF manuals (for R itself or packages, e.g. via R CMD check) by default requires the LaTeX package inconsolata. (RH 111114)

    + Revised function `requestAges' to get a pool of unaged fish identified by `SPECIMEN_SERIAL_NUMBER' from which to sample;
      - also expanded the user's choice of which field contains N fish to sample: `nfree', `ncalc', `nallo'. (RH 111012)

    + Debugged some of the mapWin GUI buttons due to some unknown change in PBSmodelling scoping behaviour. (RH 100706)

      - if TRUE (default) complete the reconstruction as previously,
      - if FALSE, terminate the code once the modern catch array has been compiled and saved
      - (to a binary file `cat123mod.rda', where 123 = species code). (RH 100622)
    + Revised the queries `phhl_vcatch_fyear.sql', `phhl_fcatch_fyear.sql', `phhl_hcatch_fyear.sql'
